The repo contains the notebook for analysis and the script for feature engineering.

## Data 
The data is provided by [ProAvalon](https://www.proavalon.com/) (created by [Victor](https://www.proavalon.com/about)). I used the latest log data (Feb. 2021) to conduct the analysis. Please refer to the [stats page](https://www.proavalon.com/statistics) if you are interested in playing with the data.

## How to run this
Just be sure having basic packages (pandas, json, pprint, collection) to run this.

#### Note: The notebook for analysis and open-source data are under development.
